# Simon-Says
Arduino project that uses buttons and lights for a Simon Says puzzle for an escape room
This project is designed to work on the Arduino Uno, using 4 led lights, and 4 round arcade buttons, though any pushbutton will work
While editing and re-writing the program, I found some functionality problems using pins set to INPUT, rather INPUT_PULLUP, so all buttons were re-wired to be pullup

The code is designed to be relatively modular and hopefully readable, for changes in the future.
